§1. #UNI_ARRAY
---------------

Type-like shorthand for array structs of a given type. Be sure to declare it
using one of the DECL_* macros first.

Variables of this type have two properties, accessible by dot notation:
 1. val: the array itself, as a pointer to the given type
 2. sz: the size of the array, expressed as the number of elements allocated

§2. #UNI_DECL_ARR
------------------

Declare an array type of another type, in the type namespace (no prefixes).

§3. #UNI_DECL_ARR_S
--------------------

Declare an array type of another struct type, in the struct namespace.
