§1. PREREQUISITES
------------------

1. Arch Linux: base-devel, clang-format, sdl2, sdl2_mixer, sdl2_ttf
2. Debian: gcc, g++, make, clang-format, libsdl2 libsdl2-mixer, libsdl2-ttf
3. macOS: XCode tools (note 1), clang-format, sdl2, sdl2_mixer, sdl2_ttf

§2. BUILD COMMAND
------------------

Use a POSIX-compliant shell, and run ‘make’ to build the default target
(debug). The ‘-j’ option is fully supported for job control, and can be given
an argument for the number of parallel jobs with the form ‘-j$(nproc)’ (on
Linux) or ‘-j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)’ (on macOS). The ‘-j$(nproc)’ form works on
macOS too if GNU coreutils is installed.

Several targets are available: debug, release, check, cov, and asan. Building
will output the executable with the suffix ‘_{dbg,rel,chk,cov,asan}’,
respectively depending on which target was chosen. This defaults to debug.
Run ‘make clean’ to delete all of the project’s ofiles; run ‘make distclean’
to do the same, additionally for in-tree 3rd-party libraries and their
outputs.
